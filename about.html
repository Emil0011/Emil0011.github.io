					<p>
					My and my team's mission is to show everyone that people can create!
					It is not only about art, it is about patience. Working with clay makes you 
					to be patient. From the beginning it may look bad, but later you will see what you have achieved.

             <h1> Vision</h1>
					<p>
					In my vision, I see that kids have huge potential. Pottery helps kids to develop their
					skills. And this is not only about physical skills, it is also about focusing, patience, 
					power, creativity, etc. I see that in the future this old hobby as pottery will re-embody and 
					will become popular.

             <h1> Values</h1>
					<p>
					We appreciate all of our participants. We love them, we build relationships with them. Most importantly, our values are to give care, love, and freedom
					in what kids are doing. We want to show that this is not only school, but also a place to find friends, or you future soulmate. We love to see the progress.
					Yet, if a kid, or an adult does not do it well, we have teachers who will definitely guide you through the process of creating 
					the sculpture.
