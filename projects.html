				<h1> Projects </h1>
					<p>
					We work with different people. There is a project that we are working on. It is called "date".
                    Date is when the couple comes to our studio and create together. We offer them food, tea, sweets, and etc.
                    If there is a teacher present he tries to be invisible because people came on the date to spend time together, 
                    and bond their attachment to each other.
